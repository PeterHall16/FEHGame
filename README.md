# Deep Space Dodge

## Game Instructions:
You are the pilot of a rocket ship in deep space that was unfortunate enough to get caught between two colliding planets. This collision spewed debris out in every direction, and you now need to navigate through it and escape the gravity of the now one planet.
You pilot the ship by tapping on the screen to give thrust, but to conserve fuel it only turns on the thrusters for a short period of time.
You gain points by traveling further away from the planet. Good Luck
